        Creative Statement
        </P>
        <p>
            I am a freshman taking my education here at Hunter, and I am aspiring to major in biology. While visual communication and interactive design may not adhere closely to my main studies, art and design has always been my lifelong passion. With experience in art and animation, I aim to take this opportunity to transform my skills. My goal is to expand my creative knowledge by not only challenging myself with unfamiliar instruction, but also pushing myself to incorporate prior artistic knowledge in this realm of creative expression.
